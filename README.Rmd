The goal of `delorean` is to make it easy to explore, download and georeference french historical aerial photo from [Remonter le temps - IGN](https://remonterletemps.ign.fr/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `delorean` like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("paul-carteron/delorean")
```
## Usage

```{r usage}
library(delorean)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(happign)
```

### Explore

`delorean` allows exploration of available aerial photos with `find_photos()`.
It intersects the `bbox` of `x` (area of interest) with all photo footprints.
Additional filters can be applied: `year`, `color`, and `oblique` (see `?delorean::find_photos`).

```{r find_photos}
x <- get_apicarto_cadastre("29158")
all_photos <- find_photos(x)

photos_1997 <- find_photos(x, year = 1997)

plot(st_geometry(photos_1997), col = "grey90", border = "grey50", main = "1997 Photo footprints")
plot(st_geometry(x), col = "firebrick", add = TRUE)

```

### Download

For downloading, use `get_photos()` with the source returned by `find_photos()`.
By default, the mode is set to `raw`, meaning the image has no spatial reference.

```{r get_photos}
# Using photo numero = 430 for the sake of example
photo_1997 <- photos_1997[photos_1997$numero == 430, ]
url <- photo_1997$url

filepath <- get_photos(url, outdir = tempdir())
photo <- rast(filepath)

plot(photo)
```

### Georeference

Historical photos from IGN are provided with a centroid, resolution, and orientation.
From these, a default georeferencing can be performed — but be aware it is **significantly inaccurate** ! (as shown below).

`get_photos()` offers two other modes: `gcp` and `warp`.
The `gcp` mode only attaches Ground Control Points (GCPs), so the photo is georeferenced but not resampled onto a regular grid.
The `warp` mode takes longer but resamples the photo to a grid, ensuring compatibility with most GIS software.

```{r default_georef}
filepath <- get_photos(url, outdir = "C:\\Users\\PaulCarteron\\Desktop\\temp\\dolorean", mode = "warp")
photo <- rast(filepath)

plot(photo)
plot(project(vect(x), crs(photo)), border = "red", lwd = 2, add = T)
```

### Georeference Help

Because the default georeferencing remains **significantly inaccurate**, `delorean` provides helpers to support manual georeferencing through the function `get_georef_helpers()`.
This wrapper around `happign::get_wfs()` downloads prominent features that can assist in georeferencing, such as hydrological elements, infrastructure, roads, and buildings.
All these layers are retrieved from IGN’s [BD TOPO® V3](https://geoservices.ign.fr/bdtopo) dataset.

```{r georegf_helpers}
georef_helpers <- get_georef_helpers(x, "infra", "other")

plot(project(vect(x), crs(photo)), col = "grey90", border = "grey50", main = "Georef helpers on Penmarc'h")
plot(vect(georef_helpers$construction_lineaire), lwd = 2, col = "forestgreen", add = TRUE)
plot(vect(georef_helpers$construction_ponctuelle), col = "firebrick", add = TRUE)
plot(vect(georef_helpers$point_de_repere), col = "royalblue", add = TRUE)

```
